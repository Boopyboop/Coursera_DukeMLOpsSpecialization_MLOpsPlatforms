# MLOps on AWS and Azure – Duke University Coursera

## What I'm Exploring

This course focuses on **implementing MLOps practices** using cloud platforms (AWS and Azure).
Through multiple modules, I’ll explore:

* End-to-end machine learning lifecycle management in the cloud
* Building CI/CD pipelines for ML projects on AWS and Azure
* Model training, packaging, deployment, and monitoring
* Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for reproducible ML environments
* Scaling and securing ML workflows in production

Each module will have **its own folder**, containing:

* A `README.md` explaining the module’s goals and work
* A `requirements.txt` with dependencies for that module
* Relevant scripts, notebooks, and configs

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mlops-aws-azure-duke.git
cd mlops-aws-azure-duke
```

### 2. Navigate to a Module Folder

Example for Module 1:

```bash
cd module-1
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
